    - :tabe tabclose tabonly tabn tabp Ngt NgT <C-w>T tabmove N
    - %a active
    - # alternative, C-^ to toggle between active and alternative
    - #h for hidden files, files that were modified but not saved
    - bn bp bfirst blast

    - bd N1 N2 ..., N,M bd
    - args {arglist} Or args cmd Or args glob or vim *.txt
    - Use find to find and open files
        - set path so they can be searched by find when looking up for files
- Markers: m{a-zA-Z} then `marker
    - A-Z works across buffers but a-z works within the same buffer
    - '' position before last jump
    - '. last change
    - '^ last insertion
    - '< marks beginning of visual selection
    - '> marks end of visual selection
    - '[ start of last change
    - '] end of last change
    - % to toggle between opening and closing such as parentheses and braces
- Navigate between files:
    - Jumps:
        - Every time we jump, Vim records the location before the jump and the location after the jump
        - We can access jump list using the command `jumps`
        - Big jumps within the file such as C-f/gg/G/%/(/{/NG are considered jumps
        - Small jumps such as w or e b are not considered jumps
        - C-o to go to previous location and C-i to go forward to new locations
        - Any jump across files is a jump
        - Each window has its own jumps list and C-i/C-o applies based on the jumps list of the active window
    - Changes:
        - Every time we change, Vim records the location before the jump and the location after the change
        - We can access change list using the command `changes`
        - g; for to go backward in the change list and g, to go foward
        - `. is the marker fort the last change while `^ is the marker for the last insertion
    - Go to files under the curser:
        - gf is the command to open the file under the curser
        - We have to change the `suffixesadd` so Vim attempts those extensions when looking for the file
        - We also have to change `path` so Vim can check all the directories in `path` for the file under the cursor'
        - The "." is the directory of the current file and the empty string is the working directory
